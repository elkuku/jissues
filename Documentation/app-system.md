## App System

### Purpose

Various system tasks

### Functionality

* **Config editor** (Currently using simple text fields where you can fill in the values).<br />
    Saving is not provided yet. When hitting the save button the config is written to the screen where you might copy&paste it ;)<br />
    If you are on PHP < 5.4 there will be only a "compressed" version of the JSON string (a "pretty print" function could be written).
